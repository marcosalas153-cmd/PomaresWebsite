            This treatment helps the skin restore its superficial layers, assisting with acne, acne scars, spots, and improving texture. What microneedles do is create a controlled micro-injury to the skin, which the body recognizes as something it needs to repair, strengthen, and improve in quality.

           Morpheus8 is an innovative aesthetic medical treatment that combines microneedling with fractional radiofrequency energy to rejuvenate and tighten the skin, stimulating collagen and elastin production. This procedure can improve fine lines, wrinkles, skin texture, acne scars, stretch marks, and body contouring, using radiofrequency to penetrate the deeper layers of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue.

            It is an aesthetic treatment in which dead skin cells and fine hair are gently removed from the skin’s surface. The result is smoother, brighter, and more even skin, which also allows creams to be absorbed better and makes makeup look more even.
